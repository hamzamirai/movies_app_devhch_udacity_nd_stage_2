# PROJECT
# Popular Movies, Stage 2
Expand on the movies app you built in Project 1 to create a fully-featured app. In this project, you’ll allow users to view and play trailers, read reviews, and mark their favorite movies. You’ll also create a database and content provider to store and handle your app data.
